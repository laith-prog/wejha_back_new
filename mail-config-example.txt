# Email Configuration for Laravel

# Add these to your .env file

# Mail Driver (smtp, sendmail, mailgun, ses, postmark, log, array)
MAIL_MAILER=smtp

# SMTP Server Settings (example for Gmail)
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Your App Name"

# For Gmail, you need to:
# 1. Enable 2-Step Verification on your Google account
# 2. Create an App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
# 3. Use that App Password here instead of your regular password

# For testing purposes, you can use the log driver
# This will write emails to storage/logs/laravel.log instead of sending them
# MAIL_MAILER=log

# For local development, you can use Mailtrap
# MAIL_MAILER=smtp
# MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
# MAIL_PORT=2525
# MAIL_USERNAME=your-mailtrap-username
# MAIL_PASSWORD=your-mailtrap-password
# MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
